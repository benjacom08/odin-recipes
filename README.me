The purpose of this lesson is to reinforce my HTML chops.
I will have demonstrated various skills like: 
* Creating an HTML index page.
* Making headings, paragraphs and manipulate text.
* Adding images and links, and adding attributes to them.
* Making lists, wether organizer or unorganized.

* If i create the HTML pages in my project directoy, I'll 
use relative links, and if I use resources from anywhere on the web, I'll use absolute links.
